These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

```
Editor
Git
Github account
Angular framework
Django framework
Django RestFramework

### Installing

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Here is a series of steps on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Click [cTicketing](https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/cTicketing) to navigate on the main page of the project repository on Github.

```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/cTicketing and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

```
Open cTicketing, the cloned Repo in terminal and run : pip install -r requirements.txt to install the app dependencies

```

```
Run source virtual/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment and python manage.py runserver to launch the app

```

## BDD
As a user, I would able to:

- view events details and reserve tickets (VIP or regular) NB: One user can reserve up to 5 tickets.
- get an email notification for the successful reservation.

As an Admin, I would able to: 
- add/ edit or remove events
- specify the ticket price specifying ticket type (VIP and regular) for each event.
- specify the maximum number of attendees for each event.
